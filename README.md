# TiCTaCToEproject
This is our first University OOC project made for Final presentation . I have made a simple Tic Tac Toe game that has both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer option. Minimax(backtracking) algorithm has been implemented in order to maximize the difficulty when playing against computer.
