# TiCTaCToEproject
This is our first University OOC project made for Final presentation . Me and my teammate have made a simple Tic Tac Toe game that has both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer Mode. Minimax(backtracking) algorithm has been implemented in order to maximize the difficulty when playing against computer.
